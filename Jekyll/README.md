Allows running of github pages locally

With the dev packages the docker images is 95 MB, but if we install both base and dev version of the packages (ruby, libffi) the images is 70MB. Unfortunatly if this is done, the images errors out. Look into this later, to make a better base image for running jekyll.

This is being used in my github page [repo](https://github.com/KyleJamesWalker/KyleJamesWalker.github.io).
